### Four data sets are used in creating these circular plots
* hourly - Radiation (hours of daylight)
- 3-hours - Lake temperature
- daily - Max and Min temperatures
- Naturalist Journal- daily observations (Aurora, Snow Present, Precipitation (Rain/snow), % cloud cover)

Plot looks good, though in the original I then editited it in Foxit PDF editor.
