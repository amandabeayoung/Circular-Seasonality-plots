# Circular-Seasonality-plots
Code for creating a circular plot showing off how climate variables vary throughout the season. 





### Four data sets are used in creating these circular plots
* hourly - Radiation (hours of daylight)
- 3-hours - Lake temperature
- daily - Max and Min temperatures
- Naturalist Journal- daily observations (Aurora, Snow Present, Precipitation (Rain/snow), % cloud cover)

Labels are added through using the package patchwork and the function inset_element.
